Project Overview:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In this project, I implemented a standard rasterized graphics pipeline. Following stages of the graphics pipeline are implemented as basic features:
* Vertex Shading
* Primitive Assembly with support for triangle VBOs/IBOs
* Perspective Transformation
* Rasterization through either a scanline or a tiled approach
* Fragment Shading
* A depth buffer for storing and depth testing fragments
* Fragment to framebuffer writing
* A simple lighting/shading scheme, such as Lambert or Blinn-Phong, implemented in the fragment shader

Following features are implemented as additional features:
* Back-face culling
* Correct color interpolation between points on a primitive
* Anti-aliasing
* MOUSE BASED interactive camera support. Interactive camera support based only on the keyboard is not acceptable for this feature.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Progress:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I started this project by first implement the standard vertex shader. I find this blog really helpful for explaining the whole vertex operation and primitive assembly operation, especially for the projection transformation: http://www.songho.ca/opengl/gl_transform.html

* A brief description of the project and the specific features you implemented.
* At least one screenshot of your project running.
* A 30 second or longer video of your project running.  To create the video you
  can use http://www.microsoft.com/expression/products/Encoder4_Overview.aspx 
* A performance evaluation (described in detail below).

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PERFORMANCE EVALUATION
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The performance evaluation is where you will investigate how to make your CUDA
programs more efficient using the skills you've learned in class. You must have
performed at least one experiment on your code to investigate the positive or
negative effects on performance. 

We encourage you to get creative with your tweaks. Consider places in your code
that could be considered bottlenecks and try to improve them. 

Each student should provide no more than a one page summary of their
optimizations along with tables and or graphs to visually explain any
performance differences.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
THIRD PARTY CODE POLICY
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Use of any third-party code must be approved by asking on Piazza.  If it is approved, all students are welcome to use it.  Generally, we approve use of third-party code that is not a core part of the project.  For example, for the ray tracer, we would approve using a third-party library for loading models, but would not approve copying and pasting a CUDA function for doing refraction.
* Third-party code must be credited in README.md.
* Using third-party code without its approval, including using another student's code, is an academic integrity violation, and will result in you receiving an F for the semester.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SELF-GRADING
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* On the submission date, email your grade, on a scale of 0 to 100, to Liam, harmoli+cis565@seas.upenn.edu, with a one paragraph explanation.  Be concise and realistic.  Recall that we reserve 30 points as a sanity check to adjust your grade.  Your actual grade will be (0.7 * your grade) + (0.3 * our grade).  We hope to only use this in extreme cases when your grade does not realistically reflect your work - it is either too high or too low.  In most cases, we plan to give you the exact grade you suggest.
* Projects are not weighted evenly, e.g., Project 0 doesn't count as much as the path tracer.  We will determine the weighting at the end of the semester based on the size of each project.

SUBMISSION
---
As with the previous project, you should fork this project and work inside of
your fork. Upon completion, commit your finished project back to your fork, and
make a pull request to the master repository.  You should include a README.md
file in the root directory detailing the following

* A brief description of the project and specific features you implemented
* At least one screenshot of your project running.
* A link to a video of your raytracer running.
* Instructions for building and running your project if they differ from the
  base code.
* A performance writeup as detailed above.
* A list of all third-party code used.
* This Readme file edited as described above in the README section.
